    "    -If it was reason 1, my trust in the model for that geographic area wouldn't go down because the data is up to date. There are still other factors that come to mind, like why the area hasn't had new houses built in a while. More external factors could also determine the pricing.\n",

    "    -If it was reason 2 on the other hand, I would question the outcome the mode outputs because it isn't up to date with current housing data in that area. Since the data is outdated, the accuracy of the model would be compromised. Common trends in the existing data may still persist, like how a bigger house with more bedrooms would be more expensive. The objective for the model is to accurately predict current house values, so an up to date set of values must be needed. \n",

    "    -If prices seem much lower than today's prices, than that could also be a factor in determining if the data is still relevant.\n"
